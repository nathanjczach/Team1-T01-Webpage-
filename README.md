### Semantic Structure Rationale

- **Header:** Establishes site identity immediately with branding
- **Nav:** Provides clear wayfinding to all major sections
- **Main:** Contains primary content, properly separating it from supplementary elements
- **Sections:** Organize content by theme (Mission, Programs, Donations, Impact)
- **Articles:** Each article is self-contained and could stand alone (program descriptions, impact stories)
- **Aside:** Contextual information that complements but doesn't interrupt main content flow
- **Footer:** Standard location for contact and legal information

### Heading Hierarchy

- `<h1>`: Site title (ToysForDogs)
- `<h2>`: Major section headings (Mission, Programs, Donate, Impact, Contact)
- `<h3>`: Article titles and subsection headings
- `<h4>`: Article subtitles and sub-subsection headings
- `<h5>`: Minor subsections within articles
- `<h6>`: Specific details within subsections

This hierarchy creates a clear content outline and improves accessibility for screen readers.

### Content Approach

All content was created manually to tell a cohesive story about the ToysForDogs organization. The content includes:
- Realistic organizational mission and values
- Detailed program descriptions
- Specific statistics and impact metrics
- Compelling success stories
- Practical donation and volunteer information

### AI Tools Used

- **Claude AI** was used for:
  - Generating initial content ideas and structure
  - Creating realistic organization statistics
  - Writing impact story narratives
  - Ensuring proper HTML semantic usage

**Note:** NO code was generated by AI. All HTML structure and implementation was written by the team. AI was only used for content generation and structural guidance as permitted by assignment guidelines.
